# 👟 Adidas Customer Retention Analytics (Power BI)

A Power BI project analyzing customer retention, churn, loyalty performance, and store-level behavior for Adidas using multiple datasets.

## 🔍 Project Overview
Adidas operates across retail stores, franchises, and online platforms.  
With strong competition and customer drop-offs, understanding:
- Why customers churn
- Who is loyal vs at-risk
- Which regions and channels perform best
is critical for business growth.

This project brings all customer, transaction, loyalty, and store data into a single Power BI dashboard to answer these questions.
